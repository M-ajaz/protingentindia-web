We talk about skillset, start schedules, situation—so you can define what fits your particular workflow. This, in turn, helps ensure the talent fits into your workflow, gives a more tailored quality of service that fits your specific needs in terms of business objectives, deadlines, and delivery timelines."

Either way, the resource is dedicated to your project, assisting your stakeholders, and is a key, integrated member of your operations."
